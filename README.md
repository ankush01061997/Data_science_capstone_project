# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

# Laptop Price pridiction 


## Project Overview :
In this project i am going to develop a machine learning algorithm which will be helpful to predict the price of the laptop by using certain craterias.The data set contains the details of Manufacturer, type of the laptop, screen size and resolution, Ram, memory, GPU, weight and price.price is changing as per the specification of the laptops.My task is to develop a ML algorithim after doing required EDA, conversion of categorical variables into numbers to use them into the algorithm.

## Problem Statement :
Predicting the price of the laptop which will be possible higher level of response from user based on Manufacturer, type of the laptop, screen size and resolution, Ram, memory, GPU, weight and price.

## Installations
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The required Python packages for this project are as follows:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.preprocessing
- sklearn.pipeline
- skleanr.compose
- metrics
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.linear_model
- sklearn.tree
- sklearn.ensemble
- Xgboost
- sklearn.svm
- sklean.neighbours
